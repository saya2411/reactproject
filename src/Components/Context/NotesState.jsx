Investments in green technologies are increasing every year. These investments may allow more countries to adopt green technologies and ditch nonrenewable resources.Factors such as improved environmental awareness, more investments and growth in the sustainability job market will help drive growth in green technology.

Metagenomics is often used to study a specific community of microorganisms, such as those residing on human skin, in the soil or in a water sample.urrent applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in functional genomics. The recent explosion of AI follows the remarkable achievements made possible by “deep learning”, along with a burst of “big data” that can meet its hunger.  This has been made possible by huge advancements in the field of high throughput technologies, applied to determine how the individual components of a biological system work together to accomplish different processes. The disciplines contributing to this bulk of data are collectively known as functional genomics. They consist in studies of: i) the information contained in the DNA (genomics); ii) the modifications that DNA can reversibly undergo (epigenomics); iii) the RNA transcripts originated by a genome (transcriptomics); iv) the ensemble of chemical modifications decorating different types of RNA transcripts (epitranscriptomics); v) the products of protein-coding transcripts (proteomics); and vi) the small molecules produced from cell metabolism (metabolomics) present in an organism or system at a given time, in physiological or pathological conditions.

        contentrunning:"Running can deliver a host of both physical and mental health benefits (as can most types of exercise, of course). Here a few to know about that have specific links to running:Boosted Mood and Energy Levels A study published in 2018 in the journal Acta Psychologica found that running as little as one to two miles can improve mood and energy levels, and had more of an effect for participants than meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery. Boosted Memory, Focus, and Task-Switching Because running causes biochemical substances called endocannabinoids to be released in the bloodstream and into the brain, it optimizes brain function, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Better Respiratory Function Along with mental health benefits, running is linked to improved cardiovascular and respiratory function because each of those systems is getting more oxygen and better blood flow, says Bryant Walrod, MD, sports medicine specialist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. Improved Cardiovascular Health A research review published in 2020 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that increased rates of participation in running, regardless of how frequently you run, shows lower risk of cardiovascular-related mortality. More Muscle Strength Although running isn't necessarily considered a strength workout, Morris says muscles in your lower body, like your hamstrings, glutes, and quads, definitely do get stronger with running (given that they have to fire up in order to keep you stabilized). Improved Bone Density A study published in 2021 in JBMR Plus looked at sprinters between 40 and 85 years old, assessing their bone density using scans taken at the start of the study and about 10 years later.Those who ran regularly maintained bone strength, and some even improved their density over time, while those who’d reduced training saw a decline in bone health. Lower Risk of Chronic Disease This is thanks to running being linked to more regulated blood pressure, blood sugar, and body weight, Walrod says. And if it helps you hit the recommended benchmark of 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, you'll decrease risk of some cancers, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Living Longer According to a research review published in 2017 in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, studies suggest runners have a 25 to 40 percent reduced risk of premature mortality and live approximately three years longer than nonrunners.And you don’t need to run every day to see benefits, Walrod says.",

But you don't want to grab just anything for hydration purposes. Electrolyte-loaded athletic drinks, for example, can be a source of unnecessary calories.So drinking water is usually fine until you're exercising for more than one hour.b.Stock Your Fridge with Healthy Foods. Foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean meats can go a long way for your fitness journey.There are even some delicious, healthy snack options to take advantage of, like hummus, grapes and walnuts, and apple slices with cheese. Additionally, some key ingredients may make it a lot easier to meet your weight-loss goals. c.Protect Yourself from Chafing You can get a chafing rash (caused by moisture and constant friction) on your thighs, around your sports bra, and even under your arms. To prevent the next occurrence, you can try a few anti-chafing products.For example, you can rub an anti-chafe stick on any spots that have the potential to chafe. Moisture-wicking fabrics help, too. So, if you have a few quick-dry shirts (Nike, Asics, and Under Armour all make them), save those for your long runs or tough workouts when chafing is most likely to occur. d.Work Out Consistently Working out at the same time during the week or on the same days can have its benefits. Researchers of a 2020 review found that for people with overweight or obesity, having consistent exercise times (particularly in the morning) was associated with the experience of weight loss and the creation of exercise habits.e.Keep Your Portions in Check When you change your diet, portion control can help with weight management.Portion control requires special attention to your current eating habits. For example, if your steak takes up more than half of your plate, you may want to consider cutting your serving of beef in half.",

In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws. Culinary tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint commoners with the cuisine bourgeoise of the urban elites and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines.
